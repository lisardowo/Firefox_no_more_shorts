# No More Shorts

`"I like You(...Tube), but I like you more with no Shorts." - Your Crush`

**No More Shorts** is a Chrome extension that removes YouTube Shorts from the homepage, sidebar, and suggested feeds to help you stay focused.

---

## Features

- Automatically removes all elements related to YouTube Shorts.
- Redirects away from any `/shorts` page back to the main YouTube homepage.
- Dynamically watches for page changes and hides Shorts as they appear.
- Lightweight, runs only on YouTube pages.

---

## How It Works

The extension injects a content script into YouTube pages. It searches for known Shorts-related elements and removes them from the DOM. It also observes the page for dynamic content changes using a `MutationObserver`, ensuring Shorts don't reappear. If the user navigates to a Shorts URL, it redirects them to the homepage.

> Hint: You can open the browser console by pressing F12 and check if you are already been _de-shorted_!

```console
Shorts removed for your focus!
Total removed in this session: 69
```
